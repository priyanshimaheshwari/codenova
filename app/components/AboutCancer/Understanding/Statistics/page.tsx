    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Cancer Statistics</h2>
    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">Cancer has a major impact on society in the United States and across the world. Cancer statistics describe what happens in large groups of people and provide a picture in time of the burden of cancer on society.</p>
    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">Statistics tell us things such as how many people are diagnosed with and die from cancer each year, the number of people who are currently living after a cancer diagnosis, the average age at diagnosis, and the numbers of people who are still alive at a given time after diagnosis. They also tell us about differences among groups defined by age, sex, racial/ethnic group, geographic location, and other categories.</p>
    <p className="text-gray-700">Cancer statistics also help us see trends. By looking at cancer rates over time, we can track changes in the risk of developing and dying from specific cancers as well as cancer overall.</p>
    <p className="text-base text-gray-800">While statistical trends may not directly apply to individual patients, they are indispensable for governments, policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers to comprehend the broader impact of cancer on the population. These trends enable the development of strategies to tackle the challenges posed by cancer at a societal level. Additionally, statistical trends serve as crucial metrics for assessing the efficacy of initiatives aimed at controlling and managing cancer.</p>
